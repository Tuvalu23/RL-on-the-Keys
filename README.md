# RL-on-the-Keys

** Description:
We are attempting to recreate the mobile video game Rocket League Sideswipe using Processing. Simply, this game is soccer., but using cars. The game consists of two playersTo recreate this game, we will have to use a plethora of PVectors. We will use PVectors for gravity, acceleration/velocity of the car and acceleration/velocity of the ball. The game will be played in 2 dimensions. The keys WASD will be used to control which way the car points. If W is pressed, the car will be pointed up. If A is pressed, the car will point and move to the left. If S is pressed, the car will be pointed down. Finally, if D is pressed, the car will point and move to the right. The SHIFT key will be used to make the car boost, which will increase the velocity at an exponential rate. The SPACE key will be used to make the car jump. Boost will be limited, but will recharge when the car is on the ground, similar to the real game. The ball will bounce off the walls. The arena is essentially a large rectangle with rounded corners with goals on each side. 

** Functionality:
After hitting the run button, the player will have the choice to 1v1 with another player or free play. After they select they will see the field, with 2 goals on each side, and the car on a random 1 of 4 spawn locations for free play but 1 of 2 for each car on 1v1.. The user will be able to control the car using the following buttons:


W: point the car up
A: point and move the car to the left
S: point the car down
D: point and move the car to the right
SPACE: make the car jump
SHIFT: make the car boost
Arrow Keys: the arrow keys will act the same as WASD for the second player
MOUSE CLICK LEFT: make the car jump for the second player
MOUSE CLICK RIGHT: make the care boost for the second player

** Libraries:
No libraries should be needed. 

** Additional Details:
None.
